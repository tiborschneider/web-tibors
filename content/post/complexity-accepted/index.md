We are very proud to announce that our [complexity analysis](../../publication/complexity) was accepted to [ICNP'22](https://icnp22.cs.ucr.edu/).
The camera-ready version is approved by our Ryan Beckett, and submitted to IEEE.
I want to thank Roland Schmid, Laurent Vanbever, Ryan Beckett, and JoaÌƒo Sobrinho for their collaboration and support.
