We are very proud to announce that [Snowcap](../../publication/snowcap) was accepted to [SIGCOMM'21](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/).
We have received all three ACM Badges: _Artifacts Available_, _Aftifacts Evaluated - Functional_ and _Results Reproduced_.
The camera-ready version is approved by our Shepherd Lixin Gao, and submitted to ACM.
I want to thank Rüdiger Birkner, Laurent Vanbever and Lixin Gao for their collaboration and support.

## History of Snowcap

_Snowcap_ was developed during my Master's Thesis at the Networked Systems Group at ETH, supervised by Rüdiger Birkner and Laurent Vanbever.
After 5 months after starting the project, and 1 month before the end of the thesis, we managed to submit the project to SIGCOMM. The entire technical work, and the writing process were part of the thesis.
